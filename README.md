##FlashCards App

In [the Leitner system], flashcards are sorted into groups according to how well the learner knows each one in Leitnerâ€™s learning box. The learners try to recall the solution written on a flashcard. If they succeed, they send the card to the next group. If they fail, they send it back to the first group.
